Guide for marketing posts

The content should be a gift for the right audience  	
Write from the audience point of view, readers should think "how do they know me so well?"
write as if we're talking 1 to 1
Use the research from talking to gamers - use negatives	 as titles

Titles
 - be dramatic
 - don't be misleading, make them pay off


Content
 - contain sub-headings and bullet points
 	- use research to make headings
 - headings should almost read like a sentance when put together, 
 - email - end on a cliffhanger - "stay tuned tomorrow because..." / "Up next..."


 Call to action - only have one and be very clear what you want them to do - make it b button
